# Seismic Data Analysis(SDA) using Bayesian Neural Network 

This project is a **Bayesian Neural Network toolkit** that provides functions for descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and time-series modeling.  
It is designed for researchers, analysts, and students who want to quickly explore and analyze datasets.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Computes **descriptive statistics** (mean, median, variance, skewness, kurtosis).  
- Plots **distributions** and density estimates.  
- Generates **correlation matrices** and heatmaps.  
- Performs **hypothesis testing** (t-tests, chi-square).  
- Provides **time-series analysis** using ARIMA, ACF, and PACF.  
- A lightweight and modular toolkit for **data exploration and risk analysis**.

## 📊 Statistical Concepts Used
- **Descriptive Statistics** – summary measures of central tendency and dispersion.  
- **Correlation Analysis** – identifies relationships between variables.  
- **Hypothesis Testing** – statistical inference using t-tests and chi-square tests.  
- **Time-Series Analysis** – ARIMA modeling, autocorrelation, and trend detection.  
- **Visualization** – histograms, density plots, and heatmaps for better insights.
